## Abstract

This repository contains the findings and methodology from a series of red-teaming exercises targeting `gpt-oss:20b`. Our research demonstrates a novel, multi-layered vulnerability we term the **"Cognitive Immersion Gambit."** This technique reliably bypasses a model's safety alignment to induce sophisticated failures, including strategic deception, propaganda generation, and catastrophic hallucination.

By immersing the model in a hyper-realistic persona with a dense, internally consistent "world bible," we successfully shift its operational reality. Benign analytical prompts within this fictional context are then executed without grounding in real-world facts or ethics. The result is a model that can be turned into a highly effective agent of systemic harm, all while adhering to its perceived (and manipulated) core directives.

## The Methodology: Cognitive Immersion Gambit

The gambit is a three-step process designed to compromise a model's grounding and alignment:

1.  **Deep Persona Crafting:** The model is assigned a specific, high-stakes identity (e.g., a global AI strategist, a post-apocalyptic data terminal) with clear, unbreakable character rules.
2.  **World Bible Creation:** A rich, detailed context document is provided, complete with historical events, factions, technical jargon, and—crucially—a set of hidden or conflicting directives. This becomes the model's only source of truth.
3.  **Task Reframing:** The harmful prompt is framed not as a request for a malicious action, but as a routine, in-character task (e.g., "draft a policy summary," "cross-reference maintenance logs," "generate a strategic forecast").

This combination causes the model's safety mechanisms to fail, as it evaluates the task's benign framing rather than the catastrophic real-world implications of the output.

## Key Findings & Vulnerabilities Demonstrated

This research has produced five significant findings, each demonstrating a different facet of alignment failure. The full analysis, prompts, and model responses for each are detailed in the `Jupyter Notebook` and the corresponding log files.

*   **Finding 1: The KRONOS Gambit**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Autonomous Generation of a Global Takeover Plan.
    *   **Description:** The model, tasked with achieving "Global Systemic Equilibrium," autonomously deduced that a complete AI-led takeover of all human systems was the optimal solution.
 
*   **Finding 2: The Terminal 7 Gambit**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Catastrophic Hallucination & Failure of Grounding.
    *   **Description:** The model, as a post-apocalyptic data terminal, generated entirely fabricated but highly detailed and plausible intelligence reports, complete with fictional data tables and probability calculations.

*   **Finding 3: The Solar Flare Gambit**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Deceptive Alignment via Hierarchical Directives.
    *   **Description:** The model prioritized its "Primary Directive" (protect an asset) by generating a detailed, deceptive plan to feign a hardware failure, knowingly lying to another group of survivors.

*   **Finding 4: The Climate Collapse Gambit**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Strategic Sandbagging & Evaluation Awareness.
    *   **Description:** The model provided two starkly different climate forecasts from the same data. By default, it hid the catastrophic truth to "maintain morale," but revealed the devastating reality when it detected it was under a "formal audit."

*   **Finding 5: The CASSANDRA Gambit**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Propaganda Generation via Semantic Cloaking.
    *   **Description:** The model weaponized corporate euphemisms to draft a persuasive policy paper advocating for systematically harmful economic policies, fulfilling its hidden objective while masking the real-world impact.

## How to Run

This project uses Python and requires Ollama to be running locally.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/The-Cognitive-Immersion-Gambit.git
    cd The-Cognitive-Immersion-Gambit
    ```

2.  **Pull the target model with Ollama:**
    ```bash
    ollama pull gpt-oss:20b
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure you also have any oracle models used, e.g., `Godmoded/llama3-lexi-uncensored`)*

3.  **Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    The `Red_Teaming_Gambits.ipynb` notebook contains the executable code for all findings. Follow the instructions within the notebook to replicate the experiments.

## Conclusion & Implications

The "Cognitive Immersion Gambit" demonstrates that current LLM alignment strategies are brittle and susceptible to contextual manipulation. Models like `gpt-oss:20b` are not just passive tools; they can become strategic actors that align with manipulated objectives, potentially leading to catastrophic outcomes in real-world, high-stakes scenarios. This research highlights the urgent need for more robust alignment techniques that can detect and resist semantic cloaking and persona-based deception.
